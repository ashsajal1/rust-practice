# rust-modules

This is a learning project to learn about modules in Rust. 

The project consists of ten modules, each covering a different topic related to modules in Rust. The modules are numbered from 1 to 10 and each module has exercises to be completed.

The project is organized in a Rust project using Cargo. The modules are organized in separate files in the `src` directory.

Each module has a description of the concepts covered and exercises to complete. The project also includes additional resources to help with learning Rust and modules.

The project includes a sample implementation of a calculator module. The calculator module has methods to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. The module follows the module pattern for encapsulation and uses traits for polymorphism.

The project includes a `main.rs` file that demonstrates how to use the calculator module.

To run the project, navigate to the project directory and run `cargo run`.
